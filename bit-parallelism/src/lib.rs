//! # Word Level Parallelism
//! 
//! Bit level algorithms for developing useful when developing specialized integer data structures such as the [x-fast trie](http://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs166/cs166.1166/lectures/15/Small15.pdf)
//! 
//! ## Overview
//! 
//! Arithmetic and logical operations take, for all intents and purposes, constant time. Such operations operate on whole words. (A word is the size of a single memory segment. This crate, assumes a word size width of `64`. For a more in-depth discussion of computer memory, refer to [this note](https://akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf)). For instance, it takes constant time to add two `64` bit numbers.
//! 
//! The central idea behind the algorithms in this library  is this:
//! 
//! * If you have a bunch of small integers â€” each smaller that sixty four bits, e.g. a bunch of bytes, we can pack many of them into a single sixty four bit integer.
//! * We can then operate on that packed integer as if it were a single number. For example, we can fit 8 byte sized numbers in a single word.
//! * By operating on the packed integer, we are in effect operating on 8 different integers in parallel. 
//! 
//! This is what is called `world level parallelism`.
//! 
//! ## Algorithms
//! 
//! The Algorithms implemented include:
//! 
//! ### Finding the `top(k)` bits of an integer
//! 
//! The first procedure is quite simple. The goal is, given a number `x` and a length `k`, to extract the first `k` bits of `x` in `O(1)`. A procedure that does this will be handy when implementing the x-fast trie.
//! 
//! ### The `SardineCan` Structure
//! 
//! Suppose we wish to maintain a set of small sized integers in a B-Tree. And suppose too that we wish to take advantage of the fact that we can fit many of these integers in a single, larger integer. How would we go about designing a single node in such a B-Tree?
//! 
//! Recall that a B-Tree of order `b` is a multi-way search tree in which each node is a bucket that must contain between `b - 1` and `2b - 1` keys. Furthermore, each node has one more child than the number of keys it contains. That is, each node must have between `b` and `2b` child nodes. Operations on B-Trees rely on one key operation: `node.rank(x)`. This operation searches through the keys of a single node (which are sorted) and either returns the location of `x` in the node, or the index of the child we need to descend into in order to complete the operation at hand. In run of the mill B-Trees, `node.rank(x)` is implemented using binary search and thus takes `O(lg b)`. However, if our keys are small integers, we can perform `node.rank(x)` in `O(1)`.
//! 
//! The `SardineCan` implements a B-Tree Node specialized for storing small integers.
//! 
//! ### `O(1)` Most Significant Bit: FourRussiansMSB
//! 
//! When we talk of the most significant bit of a number, we're often referring to the 0-indexed location of the highest bit set. Note that this is a more general problem than simply finding the number that would be formed if only the `msb` were set. For instance, `MSB(010010001)` is `7` and not `128`.
//! 
//! The simplest method for finding this index in by doing a linear scan over the bits of the number in question while keeping a count of the number of bits seen thus far. This scheme runs in `O(lg n)` where `n` is the highest number our function may operate on.
//! 
//! ```rust
//! /// A procedure for finding the index of the most significant
//! /// bit in time linear to the number of bits used
//! /// to represent the value.
//! fn get_msb_idx_of(query: u64) -> u8 {
//!     for i in (0..64).rev() {
//!         if query & (1 << i) != 0 {
//!             return i;
//!         }
//!     }
//!     panic!("MSB(0) is undefined")
//! }
//! ```
//! 
//! We can improve upon the linear scanning procedure using bit level binary search. This brings down the running time to `O(lg lg n)`. Often, however, when we know that we'll be doing many `msb` queries, we use a lookup table to compute this value. Using that method, we're able to locate the index of the highest bit set in constant  `O(1)` time, albeit with an added preprocessing step to build the lookup table.
//! 
//! We can, using bit level parallelism, locate the index of the most significant bit in constant time without using a lookup table.
